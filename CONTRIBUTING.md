# Contributing

The watsongraph library is still in a fairly early state of development, and there are quite a large number of
features which could still potentially be added to it.

To submit a minor fix: just submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Be sure
to explain what problem your change addresses!

If you are interested in contributing new features or major enhancements, we should talk! You can submit an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
summarizing the work using the "Enhancement" label. You can also [filter](https://github.com/ResidentMario/watsongraph/labels/enhancement)
to enhancements to see what's already on the radar.
