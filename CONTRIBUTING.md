# Contributing

The `watsongraph`` library is currently in its first stable release, so it is still in a fairly early state of
development: there are quite a large number of improvements and new features which could potentially be made. At the
moment I am waiting for work to finish on the [Watson Developer Cloud Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk)
so that  I can make a large volume of low-level architectural improvements (and add a few new features) for the next
planned stable release, `0.3.0`. You can see the milestone composite issues in this repository's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/ResidentMario/watsongraph/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.3.0).

To pull the latest build onto your development machine, [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository
(`git clone https://github.com/ResidentMario/cultural-insight.git`) and follow the instructions in [setup](#Setup) to
populate your access credentials.

To submit a minor fix just submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Be sure

If you are interested in contributing new features or major enhancements, we should talk! You can submit an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) summarizing the work using the "Enhancement"
 label. You can also [filter](https://github.com/ResidentMario/watsongraph/labels/enhancement)
